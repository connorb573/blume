An application made using flutter that helps you look after your houseplants. 

Users can log their houseplants, providing information about their watering (both amount of water and frequency of watering), plants species, and nicknames, as well as other miscellanous information. 

The app will send the user notifications whenever a specific plant needs to be watered, reminding them of how long has passed since the last watering and how much water they should give. 

The inspiration behind this app comes from my terrible memory when it comes to watering my houseplants. I saw it as a prime opportunity to use my recently accquired knowlege of Flutter and Dart to quite literally, save some lives.
